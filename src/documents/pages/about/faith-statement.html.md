The Bible, as originally given, is inspired by God, and every word is infallible. Through it God speaks to us. It is our authority for what we believe and practise.

_(References: 2Tim 3v15-17, 2Peter 1v 20-21, Psalm 19v7-11)_

There is only one God, revealed in the Bible as three persons: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. These three are one God, co-eternal and co-equal.

_(References: Deut 6v4, John 1v1-2, 5v17, 22-23, 14v25-26)_

The Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, became man, being conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He is both eternal God and a perfect, sinless man. God is love, and through the death of Jesus Christ on the cross He has provided the way in which sinful people can be brought into a right relationship with Him. The death of the Lord Jesus Christ is the only sacrifice for sin and through it there is freedom from the guilt and penalty of sin. On the third day after His crucifixion the Lord Jesus Christ was raised bodily from the dead and in His risen, glorified body he ascended into heaven to the right hand of God the Father. 

The Lord Jesus Christ will return in person for those who have believed in Him, both those who have died and those who are alive, and together they will be with Him forever.

_(References: Phil 2v5-11, Heb 1v1-3, John 3v16, 1Cor 15v3,4,20, IThess 4v13-18)_

Man, created by God in his image and likeness, sinned. As a result all men are sinful and guilty before God and subject to God's righteous wrath and condemnation.

_(References: Gen 1v27, Psalm 8v3-6, Rom 3v23, Isaiah 59v1-2, Rom 6v23, Rev 20v15)_

Salvation cannot be earned or deserved. It is God's free gift, given when a person repents and trusts Jesus Christ, acknowledging Him both as Saviour and Lord. Because of God's undeserved love and mercy the person who trusts in Christ receives complete forgiveness of sins, becomes a child of God and receives eternal life which can never be lost.

_(References: John 3v16, Eph 2v8-9, John 14v6, 1v12, 10v29 1Peter 1v3-5)_

The Holy Spirit indwells every believer from the moment of conversion. His role in the life of the believer is to glorify the Lord Jesus, producing increasing likeness to Christ in character and behaviour. It is the Holy Spirit who gives the power to fight against sin and to witness to the world. The Holy Spirit continues to distribute His gifts to Believers, as He chooses, in order to build up the church.

_(References: Eph 1v13, 1Cor 3v16, John 16v13-14, 1Cor ch12-14)_

There is one universal Church; the Body of Christ. Into this body, of which the Lord Jesus Christ is Head, all believers are baptised by the Holy Spirit at the moment of conversion. 

This universal Church finds expression in a local church, made up of believers, with a threefold purpose: the praise and worship of God; the upbuilding of each other in love; witness to others.
