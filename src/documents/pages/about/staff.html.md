### Chris Grant

My name is Chris Grant, CEO of Salt Factory Sports – a Christian mission organisation.  I’m married to Leah, and we have two great children – Lucy who is 10 and Levi who is 6.  We are members of ChristChurch Belfast, a non-denominational Christian Church where my wife is Children’s Deacon.

I was born in Africa to a Scottish Dad and Australian Mum so travelled the world a fair bit in my youth!  I have lived in Chad, Australia, Switzerland, Gambia, Scotland and Northern Ireland.  My previous jobs have included being a Teacher, Lecturer, Management Consultant and ICT Consultant.

I have played and coached volleyball for over 25 years and God has provided me with many great opportunities which has seen me coach in various situations from Primary Schools, to professional teams and right up to Olympic teams.  I played on the N.I. National Team for 9 years in European and World Competitions and then coached our National Team for 4 years.   I am currently coaching the Kenyan Women’s Volleyball Team as we head into qualifying for the 2015 World Cup and 2016 Olympics.  I have also led numerous coaching and technical seminars, developed progression pathways for talented athletes and developed the SPIES (Spiritual, Physical, Intellectual, Emotional, Social) programme to help elite athletes either live out their faith, or discover faith, in the high-pressure world of professional and international competition.

It took me a while, and three tragic events, to realise God wanted me to use my sport to share his love and salvation – I was probably blinded by my desire to win, but as God opens more and more doors for me, I am so blessed to be able to combine my love of sport with sharing the love of God.

I founded Salt Factory Sports, a Christian mission organisation, in 2010 and we now work across the UK and Africa.  Our aims are to use sport as a means to engage and evangelise people and to disciple Christian athletes to go out and be the Salt and Light in their sport.  Along with our weekly “Play Believe Live” programmes, we regularly lead mission trips abroad and host mission teams in the UK and last year saw 73 people give their lives to Christ.
