11810 miles, £17,500 raised, 400 kilos of clothing donated, 1000 maximum security prisoners, 850 boarding school girls, 1 trip to hospital, 50 street children fed, 60 Kenyan leaders trained, 400 children at camp, 9 brilliant Northern Ireland leaders, 65 children giving their lives to Christ, 2 safari jeeps, 3 lions and one albino lizard. Kenya 2014 in numbers. 

Looking at these figures now, the level of effort and dedication our team put in both before and during the trip seem unbelievable. They gloss over the months of prayer, discussion, skype calls, emails, fundraising, team meetings and general preparations that were necessary to make the mission happen, and also do not reveal the hard work of our joint N.I. / Kenyan mission leadership team. 

Was it all worth it? Absolutely! For 3 main reasons:

1. 65 children gave their lives to Jesus at the camp 
2. 60 Kenyan leaders are now better equipped to run evangelism activities on a year-round basis and are more comfortable discipling young Christians
3. Our own team members have seen and felt God in their lives and are determined to live non-conformist lives for Him

Only 2 years ago we could never have imagined all this was possible. God has opened so many doors, given us so many wonderful and exciting opportunities and led us to work alongside some inspiring and Godly people – all for which we are eternally grateful! The speed of it all still surprises me, but I certainly am glad to be on the ride!

This year we were invited into a maximum security prison to run a football and volleyball tournament. This also gave us the opportunity to share testimonies, preach God’s Word and pray with 1000 prisoners, many of whom are serving life sentences or are on death row. The Prison Governor is keen to use sport and religion to keep the prisoners engaged and as he heard that the prisoners really enjoyed the day and were peaceful, we have been invited to lead a week-long event in the prison next year. 

We also got the opportunity to share testimonies, preach and pray with 850 girls at a local boarding school - their cheerful screaming on our arrival was definitely on a par with a One Direction concert! Many other schools wanted us in, but our time was too short.

We spent three days training local Christian leaders, focussing mainly on Jesus’ examples of unconditional love, humility and compassion then led the children’s camp alongside these leaders. We took part in worship, Bible 
stories, memory verses, small group discussions, prayer, quizzes, fun team games and then sports activities in the afternoons. So much work. So much fun. So many blessings.

Salt Factory Sports’ mix of evangelism, discipleship and sports activities seems to work very well in this sports-mad country, and we have been so blessed to see many adults and children coming to know Him. The strong relationships we now have with local Churches, schools, other Christian charities and individuals are a great base from which we can develop our activities and we are already planning for future missions. Are you in???

Oh, I nearly forgot- one last number for you. 4 free upgrades on the first leg of the journey home. Thankfully I was one of them!
