## Our Vision
#### We want to see the transformation of individuals, teams and communities through relational sports evangelism and discipleship.

## Our Mission Statement
We use sport as an effective means of bring people together, building relationships and creating opportunities for evangelism and discipleship. Our mission trips allow participants to develop their personal relationship with God while sharing their faith through words and actions, and we train and equip Churches to begin and develop their own sustainable sports evangelism programmes.

## Our Aims
We aim to:
-  partner with Churches to train and equip them to use sport as an effective means of engaging, building relationships with and evangelising   their local communities;
- use games, sports activities, events and competitions at all levels of ability to create evangelism and discipleship opportunities;
- equip, develop and disciple those serving on our mission teams;
- bring together Christian sportspeople for regular fellowship, Bible study and prayer
