## Our Vision
#### We want to see the transformation of individuals, teams and communities through relational sports evangelism and discipleship.

## Our Mission Statement
We use sport as an effective means of bring people together, building relationships and creating opportunities for evangelism and discipleship. Our mission trips allow participants to develop their personal relationship with God while sharing their faith through words and actions, and we train and equip Churches to begin and develop their own sustainable sports evangelism programmes.

## Our Aims
We aim to:
-  partner with Churches to train and equip them to use sport as an effective means of engaging, building relationships with and evangelising   their local communities;
- use games, sports activities, events and competitions at all levels of ability to create evangelism and discipleship opportunities;
- equip, develop and disciple those serving on our mission teams;
- bring together Christian sportspeople for regular fellowship, Bible study and prayer


## Where did it all start?
Salt Factory Sports began in 2010 when, after a series of tragic accidents involving his players, Chris realised he should use his love of sport and the influence he had on his teams to share God’s love and grace; to be the “Salt and Light” in his sport.  He spent a lot of time with his teams and recognised that his words and actions in the often stressful world of Club and International sport could be a great way of demonstrating his faith and showing God’s glory to others.

Our work has expanded as God has opened doors for us both locally and internationally, and now we work alongside schools, youth clubs, youth organisations, Universities, other Christian sports charities, Churches, sports clubs, Governing Associations and professional teams.  We have also increased our range of activities from just coaching, to coach education programmes, Christ-centred leadership development programmes, Christian athlete mentoring programmes, discipleship programmes, leading camps, taking mission teams to Africa and hosting teams from the USA.
