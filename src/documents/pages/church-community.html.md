**Background**

God has commissioned His church to make disciples of all nations; believers are called to be disciples who share the gospel and make disciples of others. However, it can sometimes be difficult to know how we can connect with people in the community who need to be introduced to Jesus; many have little interest in Christianity and some have never heard the life changing message of the gospel.

Sport can be one very effective means of bridging that gap. It is a language that everyone understands, is enjoyed by billions of people all over the world and has the potential to build relationships, engage people with the local Church and be used to transform lives and communities.

The Salt Factory Sports Church Partnership initiative is designed to ignite, enthuse, train and equip Christians to use sport as a means of getting out into their local community, sharing the gospel and connecting people to the local Church for ongoing discipleship.

Participants / leaders do not have to be actively involved in sport themselves, or have any experience in running sports activities, but must have a desire to use sports and activities as a means of outreach and evangelism.  Leaders are normally aged 18 and over and need to be Access N.I. cleared.

**Purpose**

**To see:**

* small groups of people from local Churches enthused, trained and equipped in using sport as an effective means of engaging, building relationships with and evangelising their local communities.

* local Churches running regular sports ministry throughout the year.

* (Depending on location, facilities and leaders available, this could be run as a cluster of local Churches working together in their community.)*

**Benefits for Churches**

**Leaders will:**

- be encouraged to develop their own personal relationship with God

- be enthused, trained and equipped in sports ministry

- be able to lead regular sports ministry (or to add a sports element to an existing programme)

- have the opportunity to participate in a sports ministry mission trip

**In order to:**

- see an increase in local Church engagement and attendance from members of their community

- have the privilege of seeing children, youth and adults giving their lives to Jesus

**Cost**

There is no charge for Churches or individuals to be trained and supported in beginning local sports ministry.  However as a faith ministry, we appreciate any financial gift you are able to give.

**Approach**

SFS will have an initial meeting with the Church leader who will then put together a team interested in local sports ministry.  SFS will meet with the Church leader and their team to discuss options, issues, ways forward and to plan.  SFS will then lead some equipping, both theoretical and practical, for team members after which they will be able to begin sports ministry with support from SFS.  This will be followed by a second round of equipping, leading to on-going sports ministry with reduced support from SFS.  There will be opportunities for team members to observe sports ministry in other areas and to participate in a local or foreign mission trip.
